Layout Dialect\n\n\n\n\nA dialect for Thymeleaf that lets you build layouts and reusable templates in\norder to improve code reuse.\nIf you've ever used SiteMesh for your JSPs, or Facelets with JSFs, then the\nconcepts of this library will be very familiar to you.\nMotivation\nAfter coming off a project that used JSFs and having a long hard look at my\npersonal website written in JSPs, I thought it was high time for a site redesign\nthat used a view technology that didn't make me want me to ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\nI came across an article on this new thing called Thymeleaf\nand how it's a fully-fledged JSP replacement.  I gave it a look, and in seconds\nit restored my faith in Java web development; using the language of HTML to\ncreate HTML, rather than trying to throw Java code into a place it doesn't\nbelong.\nOne problem though: I had been using SiteMesh to create reusable layouts, but\nThymeleaf offered no such alternative.  Some people had tried to shoehorn\nSiteMesh into Thymeleaf, but with mixed results.  Seeing how extensible\nThymeleaf could be, I embarked on writing my own layout alternative for\nThymeleaf and, as soon as I got that working on my website, I shared the result\nwith the community in this project here.\nMy website still runs on Thymeleaf and the layout dialect, and uses every\nfeature mentioned in these docs.  In eating my own dogfood, I hope that the\nlayout dialect is robust enough for your own projects, from personal websites\nlike my own, to larger high-traffic web apps.  Anywhere Thymeleaf is suitable, I\nhope the layout dialect can be suitable too :)\n"},"Installation.html":{"url":"Installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nMinimum of Java 7 and Thymeleaf 3.0 required.\nStandalone distribution\nCopy the JAR from one of the release bundles,\nplacing it in the classpath of your application, or build the project from the\nsource code on GitHub.\nFor Maven and Maven-compatible dependency managers\nAdd a dependency to your project with the following co-ordinates:\n\nGroupId: nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf\nArtifactId: thymeleaf-layout-dialect\nVersion: (see the project releases\nfor a list of available versions)\n\nUsage\nOnce downloaded/installed as part of your project, add the Layout dialect to\nyour existing Thymeleaf template engine.\nFor those who are configuring their own Thymeleaf template engine:\nTemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();  // Or SpringTemplateEngine for Spring\ntemplateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect());\n\nFor those using XML config in Spring:\n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor those using Spring Boot 2 and Java configuration:\n@Bean\npublic LayoutDialect layoutDialect() {\n    return new LayoutDialect();\n}\n\n\nThe layout dialect is already included as part of the Thymeleaf starter pack\nin Spring Boot 1.x, but has been removed in Spring Boot 2, hence the\nadditional config step for Spring Boot 2 users above.\n\nThis will introduce the layout namespace, and 5 new attribute processors that\nyou can use in your templates: decorate, title-pattern, insert, replace,\nand fragment.\n"},"Processors.html":{"url":"Processors.html","title":"Processors","keywords":"","body":"Processors\ndecorate\n\nXML attribute: layout:decorate\nData attribute: data-layout-decorate\n\nUsed in your content templates and declared in the root tag (usually ),\nthis processor takes a fragment expression\nthat specifies the layout template to decorate with the current, content\ntemplate.\nCheck out the Layouts example for how to decorate a\nlayout template with your content templates.\ntitle-pattern\n\nXML attribute: layout:title-pattern\nData attribute: data-layout-title-pattern\n\nAllows for greater control of the resulting  element by specifying a\npattern with some special tokens.

This is the default in a lot of framework configurations, such as\nSpring Boot.\n\n\nLayouts\nCreate a template that will contain a layout that will be shared across\ntemplates.  Often this will be a template that contains a page header,\nnavigation, a footer, and a spot where your content will go.\nLayout.html\n\n\n\n\n  Layout page\n  \n\n\n  \n    My website\n  \n  \n    Page content goes here\n  \n  \n    My footer\n    Custom footer here\n    \n\n\n\nNotice how the layout:fragment attribute was applied to the  and\n element in the footer.  These are the points in the layout that are\ncandidates for replacement by matching fragments in your content templates.\nNow, create some content templates.\nContent1.html\n\n\n\n\n  Content page 1\n  \n\n\n  \n    This is a paragraph from content page 1\n  \n  \n    This is some footer content from content page 1\n  \n\n\n\nThe layout:decorate in the  tag says which layout template to decorate\nusing this content template.  The content template defines its own title and\nscript, as well as both the content and custom-footer fragments.  The custom-footer\nfragment is within a  element, which isn't really necessary, but might\nbe handy if you wish to do static templating of the content template which is\none of the reasons one uses Thymeleaf in the first place :)\n\nFragment names must be unique within a template, otherwise fragment mismatches\ncan occur and all sorts of hilarity will ensue.\n\nAnyway, once you tell Thymeleaf to process Content1.html, the resulting page\nwill look like this:\n\n\n\n  Content page 1\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    My website\n  \n  \n    This is a paragraph from content page 1\n  \n  \n    My footer\n    This is some footer content from content page 1\n    \n\n\n\nThe content template decorated Layout.html, the result being a combination of\nthe layout, plus the fragments of the content template ( elements from\nboth templates, with the  element from the content template taking\nplace of the layout's, all elements from the layout, but replaced by all content\ntemplate fragments where specified).\nFor more on how you can control the merging of  elements, see the\n element merging section.\n\nThe decoration process redirects processing from your content template to the\nlayout, picking layout:fragment parts out of your content template as the\nlayout demands them.  Because of this, anything outside of a layout:fragment\nwithin the  in your content template never actually gets executed,\nmeaning you can't do this in your content template:\n\n  \n    ...\n  \n\n\nIf the layout template wants the 'content' fragment, then it'll get that\nfragment, regardless of any conditions around it because those conditions\naren't executed.\n\nSay you just want to replace only the footer of your decorator with the\nabsolute minimum of HTML code:\nContent2.html\n\n\n  This is some footer text from content page 2.\n\n\nAnd that's all you need!  The  tag acts as both root element and fragment\ndefinition, resulting in a page that will look like this:\n\n\n\n  Layout page\n  \n\n\n  \n    My website\n  \n  \n    Page content goes here\n  \n  \n    My footer\n    \n      This is some footer text from content page 2.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nYou can think of the layout as your parent template that will get filled-up or\noverwritten by your content (child templates), but only if your content chooses\nto fill-up/overwrite the parent.  This way the layout acts as a sort of\n'default', with your content acting as implementations on top of this default.\nPassing data to layouts\nSince locating templates is done using standard Thymeleaf fragment expressions,\nthese can also be used to pass data from child templates up to their parent\nlayouts, eg:\nChild/content template:\n\n\nParent/layout template:\n\n  ...\n   \n\n\nParameters passed this way must be named - an exception will be thrown if\nnames are missing.\n\nThis feature is available from Thymeleaf Layout Dialect 2.4.0.  For older\nversions, you can continue to use th:with/data-th-with:\n\n\nConfiguring your title\nGiven that the Layout dialect automatically overrides the layout's \nwith that found in the content template, you might find yourself repeating parts\nof the title found in the layout, especially if you like to create breadcrumbs\nor retain the name of the website in the page title.  The layout:title-pattern\nprocessor can save you the trouble of repeating the layout title by using some\nspecial tokens in a pattern of how you want your title to appear.\nHere's an example:\nLayout.html\n\n\n\n\n  My website\n\n...\n\n\nThe layout:title-pattern processor takes a simple string that recognizes 2\nspecial tokens: $LAYOUT_TITLE and $CONTENT_TITLE.  Each token will be\nreplaced by their respective titles in the resulting page.  So, if you had the\nfollowing content template:\nContent.html\n\n\n\n\n  My blog\n\n...\n\n\nThe resulting page would be:\n\n\n\n  My website - My blog\n\n...\n\n\nThis works for both static/inlined text inside the  elements, or\ndynamic text using th:text found on the  element.\nThe pattern in the example above was specified in the layout, so applies to all\ncontent templates that make use of the layout.  If you specify another title\npattern in the content template, then it will override the one found in the\nlayout, allowing for fine-grained control of the appearance of your title.\nReusable templates\nSay you have some HTML or structure that you find repeating over and over and\nwant to make into its own template that you insert from several places to reduce\ncode duplication.  (Modular Thymeleaf anybody?)  An example of this might be a\nmodal panel consisting of several HTML elements and CSS classes to create the\nillusion of a new window within your web application:\nModal.html\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        My Modal\n        \n          Close\n        \n      \n      \n        My modal content\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nYou find you can turn some things into variables like the header and IDs so that\npages including Modal.html can set their own name/IDs.  You continue making\nyour modal code as generic as possible, but then you get to the question of\nfilling-in the content of your modal panel, and that's where you start to reach\nsome limitations.\nSome of the pages use a modal that has a simple message, others want to use the\nmodal to hold something more complex like a form to accept user input. The\npossibilities for your modal become endless, but to support your imagination you\nfind yourself having to copy this modal structure into each template and vary\nthe contents for each use case, repeating the same HTML code to maintain the same\nlook-and-feel, breaking the DRY principle\nin the process.\nThe main thing holding you back from proper reuse is the inability to pass HTML\nelements to the inserted template.  That's where layout:insert comes in.  It\nworks exactly like th:insert, but by specifying and implementing fragments\nmuch like with content/layout examples, you can create a common structure that\ncan respond to the use case of the template inserting it.\nHere's an updated modal template, made more generic using Thymeleaf and the\nlayout:fragment attribute to define a replaceable modal content section:\nModal2.html\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        My Modal\n        \n          Close\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          My modal content\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNow you can insert this template using the layout:insert processor and\nimplement the modal-content fragment however you need by creating a fragment\nof the same name within the insert element of the calling template:\nContent.html\n\n\n\n  ...\n  \n    Message goes here!\n  \n  ...\n\n\nJust like with the content/layout example, the layout:fragment of the template\nyou're inserted will be replaced by the element with the matching fragment name.\nIn this case, the entire modal-content of Modal2.html will be replaced by\nthe custom paragraph above.  Here's the result:\n\n\n  ...\n  \n    \n      \n        Message\n        \n          Close\n        \n      \n      \n        Message goes here!\n      \n    \n  \n  ...\n\n\nThe custom message defined in the template including Modal2.html was made a\npart of the contents of the modal.  Fragments in the context of an inserted\ntemplate work the same as they do when used in the context of the content/layout\nprocess: if the fragment isn't defined in your template, then it won't override\nwhatever is in the inserted template, allowing you to create defaults in your\nreusable templates.\n"},"Configuration.html":{"url":"Configuration.html","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Configuration\n element merging\nWhen decorating the  sections of the content and layout templates, the\ndefault behaviour is to place all content elements after the layout ones, eg:\nContent.html\n\n\n  Hello!\n  \n  \n\n\nLayout.html\n\n\n  Goodbye!\n  \n  \n\n\nResult:\n\n  Hello!\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nHowever, sometimes we need a smarter merging of elements, such as grouping like\nelements together (having scripts with scripts and stylesheets with stylesheets).\nContent.html\n\n\n  Hello!\n  \n  \n\n\nLayout.html\n\n\n  Goodbye!\n  \n  \n\n\nResult:\n\n  Hello!\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe Layout dialect can be configured to support either use case, with the\nability for developers to define their own sorting.\nThis sorting is exposed by the nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.SortingStrategy\ninterface and the layout dialect provides 4 implementations to choose from:\n\nnz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.AppendingStrategy, the\ndefault, appends content  elements after layout ones.  Deprecated.\nnz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingStrategy, groups like\nelements together.  Deprecated.\nnz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.AppendingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy,\na new variant of the AppendingStrategy which respects the position of the\n element based on its position in the layout template.\nnz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy,\na new variant of the GroupingStrategy which respects the position of the\n element based on its position in the layout template.\n\n\nThe default behaviour of the layout dialect has historically been to place the\n element at the beginning of the  element during the\ndecoration process; an arbitrary design decision which made development of\nthis library easier.  However, this runs against the expectations of\ndevelopers who wished to control the order of elements, most notably the\npractice of putting  as the first element in the .\nThe new strategies (ones with RespectLayoutTitle in their name) instead keep\ns wherever they exist within the target/layout template being\ndecorated, and then work on everything else as normal.\nThe RespectLayoutTitle strategies were introduced in version 2.4.0 and will\nbecome the default strategies from version 3.x.  The existing strategies are\nnow deprecated but retain the historic behaviour, maintaining backwards\ncompatibility with the 2.x versions.\n\nTo change to the grouping strategy, configure the Layout dialect using one of\nthe methods below.\nFor those who are configuring their own Thymeleaf template engine:\nTemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();  // Or SpringTemplateEngine for Spring\ntemplateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect(new GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy()));\n\nFor those using XML config in Spring:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor those using Spring Boot and Java configuration:\n@Bean\npublic LayoutDialect layoutDialect() {\n    return new LayoutDialect(new GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy());\n}\n\nIf neither strategy suits your needs, you can implement your own SortingStrategy\nand pass it along to the layout dialect like above.\nBypassing  element merging altogether\nFrom version 2.4.0, an experimental option was added to skip the special \nmerging entirely.  Reasons for this might be that you wish to manage that\nsection yourself so are using things like Thymeleaf's th:replace to fill that\nspecial part of your HTML document in.\nTo bypass the layout dialect's  element merging, a second parameter to\nthe LayoutDialect constructor should be set to false.  (The first parameter\ncan be set to null as a merging strategy isn't really relevant when \nelement merging is disabled.)\nFor those who are configuring their own Thymeleaf template engine:\nTemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();  // Or SpringTemplateEngine for Spring\ntemplateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect(null, false));\n\nFor those using Spring Boot and Java configuration:\n@Bean\npublic LayoutDialect layoutDialect() {\n    return new LayoutDialect(null, false);\n}\n\nWhen disabled, the  element will be whatever it was in the content\ntemplate, so the  from the layout is not applied.\n"},"MigrationGuide.html":{"url":"MigrationGuide.html","title":"Migrating to 2.0","keywords":"","body":"Migrating to 2.0\nThe biggest change between 1.x and 2.x of the layout dialect is that 2.x is a\nrewrite of the layout dialect to support Thymeleaf 3.  Thymeleaf 3 is largely\nbackwards compatible with Thymeleaf 2 templates, and so the layout dialect has\ngone out of its way to be backwards compatible too.\nAs such, everything in this guide is completely optional.

In\nThymeleaf 3, these specifiers have been formalized into \"fragment expressions\",\nand have a new syntax which surrounds the old one with ~{...}.\nThe layout dialect now favours the use of these fragment expressions for all\nprocessors that pick a template or fragment.\n"}}}
